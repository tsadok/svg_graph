=head1 AUTHOR

Jonadab the Unsightly One perpetrated this mess.  Blame him.

=head1 BUGS

This code is in early development, so almost all the features are
missing, and there are probably lots of bugs.  Fortunately, the source
code is provided, so if you have problems you can probably figure them
out and fix them on your own, assuming you are a Perl programmer.

Reporting discovered bugs to the author is encouraged.  The fastest
way to reach me is on the Freenode IRC network, where I normally go
by B<jonadab> and tend to leave my client connected 24/7, so even if
I am not actually online, you can leave me a /msg and I should get it
the next time I am online, in most cases.
